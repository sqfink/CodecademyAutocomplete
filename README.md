CodecademyAutocomplete
======================

Hate doing menial tasks on Codecademy but want it to look like you completed everything? Run this simple JS bookmarklet to autocomplete the currently open project.

Usage: 
Copy the content of bookmarklet.js into a new bookmark as the link location
Log into Codecademy and open the first exercise in each section, wait a few seconds for the site data to load then click the bookmarklet.
This script will complete most of the exercises in the section. To complete the uncompleted exercises just open them and click submit. 

The code contained in bookmarklet.js is the same code as the complete.js, just modified to be a 1 liner for a bookmarklet.


All code is based on reverse engineering of the Codecademy JS files and network traffic.
